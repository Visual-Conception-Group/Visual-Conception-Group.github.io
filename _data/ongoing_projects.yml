  description: "Intelligent video analytics is one of the important aspects in a smart city planning. The huge video traffic that is generated day-to-day is impossible to manually scan and there is a pressing need for automated solutions. Tremendous progress has been made in this field in the recent past owing to the success of powerful deep learning models. Leveraging these developments, the focus of the project will be to automate the process with minimal human-in-loop intervention and shall be capable of dealing with multimedia data.

  duration: "2021-24"
  description: "Revolutionary advances in the field of medical imaging have led to improved diagnostics in all areas of medicine. In addition, these advanced imaging thus obtained are the backbone of pre and periprocedural planning in modern day interventions and surgeries. The interpretation of these medical images however remains limited by the way these datasets are visualized in clinical practice. Obviously, a method of visualization understood by all the team members managing a particular case is much more useful than the current standard of interpretation by expert radiologist. Fortunately, concurrent advancement in the field of computation and graphics has made variety of three-dimensional visualization feasible at a speed suitable for clinical usage. Currently, there are commercially available software for analysis of CT datasets provided by almost all the companies producing CT scanners. Volume rendered images created from these software packages however are limited, while others are not available in India. In addition, these software packages are prohibitively costly. In absence of optimal visualization, the imaging fails to reach its potential despite acquiring high quality data. The idea here is to provide a better 3D visualization of medical data.
